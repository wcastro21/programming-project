# Programming Project
## - Our project takes a look at the Fraud Detection in Transactions Dataset, provided by Kaggle and made by Şahide ŞEKER
## - The questions we decided to focus on were:
### 1. How much of each purchase type was used in these Fraud Transactions?
### 2. How much of each device type was used in these Fraud Transactions?
### 3. What is the average amount spent for each type of purchase type?
### 4. Which Device Type on average spent the most amount of money during these Fraud Transactions?
