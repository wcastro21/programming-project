# Programming Project
## Our project takes a look at the Fraud Detection in Transactions Dataset, provided by Kaggle and made by Şahide ŞEKER
## With the evergrowing presence of both online shopping and banking, hackers and scammers are becoming more able to access our funds and make purchases with them. This project will go through 1000 hypothetical transactions, and we will be able to see how many of these transactions are actually fraudalent. 
## The questions we decided to focus on were:
### 1. How many fraudalent purchases were there compared to real purchases?
### 2. What purchase type was most prevalent in these Fraud Transactions?
### 3. How much of each device type was used in these Fraud Transactions?
### 4. What is the average amount spent for each type of purchase type?
### 5. Which Device Type on average spent the most amount of money during these Fraud Transactions?
## All answers to these questions will be provided in both the project.html and project.ipynb files.
